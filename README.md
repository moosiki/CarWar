<h2 align="center">A New Android MVP Architecture</h2>  


**This framework is designed to solve the traditional **MVP** class and interface too much, and **Presenter** and **View** communicate too complicated through the interface, reuse **Presenter** too much cost**


## Architectural

## Introduction
> [**Master** Branch](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArt/tree/master)
>> **Master** branch is a simple framework without network layer, mainly through the four **Demo** introduced the framework of the ideas, features and use of methods, compact and flexible has a set of existing framework but need to refactor For **MVP** structure of the project, but no matter which branch you are using is strongly recommended that you first look at **Master** branch **Demo**
  
> [**Complete** Branch](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArt/tree/complete)
>> **Complete** branch is a complete framework with a network layer, **Retrofit** as a network layer and use **Dagger2** to manage all objects, mature and powerful for new projects

## Notice
* [Use Template to automatically generate MVP classes](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArmsTemplate)

* This framework is a lightweight framework, more suitable for small and medium-sized projects, large-scale projects please use [MVPArms](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArms)

* Traditional MVP corresponds to a **Presenter**, and most **Presenter** has only one or two methods, which leads to the existence of a large number of very few tags **Presenter**, this framework is designed to solve the reuse **Presenter** need to achieve too many redundant interface method, encourage developers to write similar logic in a **Presenter**, constantly reuse **Presenter**, reduce a large number of class files
* Of course, many different logic is written in a **Presenter**, although you can write a lot of classes, but behind the expansion is certainly not good, so the size of their own control, but for the outsourcing project is very useful
